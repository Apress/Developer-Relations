## Developer Relations Program Directory

Have you ever been asked "How many DevRel Programs are there?"
So have we, and we never had a good answer, or a reference to point to.
We hope this Program Directory solves that for us all.

The idea is to crowdsource a list of all the DevRel programs out there, which will be beneficial for a number of reasons, including to:

* Describe the size of the DevRel community for the first time
* Provide examples and data to aid investment into your programs
* Forge new links between programs
* Aid career growth
